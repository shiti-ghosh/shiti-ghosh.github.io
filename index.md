# Welcome to My Bioinformatics Portfolio

With over six years of coursework and a solid foundation in wet lab techniques, my journey in biotechnology has been shaped by a deep-seated curiosity for understanding life at its molecular level. My inquisitiveness to find patterns within the vast realm of biological data has inspired me to walk the path of bioinformatics. My aspiration is to leverage high-throughput data techniques to derive actionable insights that propel scientific discovery and therapeutic innovation.
